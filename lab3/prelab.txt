Question 1:
The instruction fetch stage in the MIPS processor will read
from instruction memory at the program counter PC. The fetch
will then pass the instruction to the instruction decoder
so that the instruction may be run. The instruction fetch
will not write to any memory (only read).

Question 2:
The instruction decode stage will take an instruction from
the instruction fetch stage and break down the portions of
the instruction. These pieces will be passed to various parts
of the processor to control different portions. For example,
the ALU and register file have various control parameters.
The decode stage will also control whether or not output data
is written to a register or to memory or not at all.
